## Overview

### The project

This project is another one that was built in Angela Yu course - Web Development Full Course - on Udemy. It was the most complex project since I started the course.
The simon game is a memory game that show us a sequence that is incremented every time we remember the correct sequence. The new thing here was the Jquery javascript library which was the target of last study module.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JQuery

### What I learned

First of all, I tried to build the game only by myself and even getting constructed some features correctly, I couldn't make it entire functional. So I went to the game original resources and changed the logic errors.
It was a good chance to test what I have studied and at the end of all, now is more clear what I need to improve.

Moreover, I can't forget how Jquery accelerated the development with its short syntax.

Select elements is really easy with jquery:

```js
$('#level-title')
```

Selecting the same with pure javascript:

```js
window.document.getElementById('level-title')
```
